I'm building a React Native app using JavaScript to recognize and teach American Sign Language (ASL). I already have an app/(auth) folder for authentication (e.g., login, register).
Now, I want to create a new folder called app/(tabs) that contains subfolders for each main tab in the bottom navigation bar. The tabs are:

Home

Recognize

Learn

Profile

Each of these tabs should have its own folder inside app/tabs, and each folder should contain an index.js file as the entry point for the screen.

I also need a Layout.js file that defines the bottom tab navigation layout (like in the attached screenshot). This file should include a Tab.Navigator with 4 Tab.Screens for the tabs mentioned above.

I want the following structure generated:

Copy
Edit
app/
├── auth/
│ ├── Login.js
│ ├── Register.js
│ └── ...
├── tabs/
│ ├── Home/
│ │ └── index.js
│ ├── Recognize/
│ │ └── index.js
│ ├── Learn/
│ │ └── index.js
│ ├── Profile/
│ │ └── index.js
│ └── Layout.js
└── App.js
Please use @react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/bottom-tabs.
The Layout.js should configure the navigation logic and include icons (you can use placeholders like Ionicons or similar).
Each screen should export a simple component (e.g., "Home Screen", "Recognize Screen", etc.) for now, just for testing navigation.

Output the code for each of the following files:

App.js — wraps everything with NavigationContainer and renders the Layout

tabs/Layout.js — contains BottomTab.Navigator with 4 tabs

tabs/Home/index.js

tabs/Recognize/index.js

tabs/Learn/index.js

tabs/Profile/index.js
